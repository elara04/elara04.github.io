									I am a physics and Computer Science double major. I enjoy learning complex concepts 
									and breaking them down to their fundamentals. My favorite part about both these disciplines 
									is the problem-solving aspects. So far in my academic journey I have enjoyed data analysis along with 
									algorithm design. I am currently finding cycler security is also of interesting but it’s still relatively 
									new to me since starting to learn the concept in the spring of 2022 semester. Next, I look forward to learning Artificial
									 Intelligence in the coming semester. From a physics standpoint my best well know subject is Electricity and Magnetism which is my favorite branch of physics to study. 
									 I find the theory very fascinating which always peaks my interest and curiosity that I always seem to study it in my free time. Lately I have been focusing on circuit analysis aspect 
								</p>

								<p>
									Outside of academia my main interest is music. Besides listening and discovering music from different countries 
									I specifically like learning music theory and music production. Since the start of the pandemic in March of 2020 I have taken 
									the time to learn the Ableton Live software. It is a digital studio work stating that can be utilized in all aspect of music making process. 
									I’m currently using the software to learn sound design which is my favorite part of the music making process. I enjoy building sound scrapes and sonics that could be
									utilized in music, movies, and video games. Another hobby of mine is learning languages, the languages I have studied are Spanish and German. I wouldn’t consider myself 
									fluent in them but I do enjoy being able to communicate and understand different cultures through their languages and trying their food. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in Germany for two years. 
								   
								</p>
								<p>
									In terms of work experience From December of 2019 to present time I have been a physics Lab technician for the California State University of Fullerton physics department. 
									I am responsible of setting up and tearing down the physics lab rooms every week for all the physics lab courses that are offered. That also include trouble shooting lab equipment that is functioning properly.
									 I am also responsible for setting up day and night astronomy telescope observation held periodically thought the semester. Prior to this current job from September of 2015- September of 2019 I was a private physics tutor for high school and college students. 
									 I mainly tutored mechanics and electricity and magnetism. For my first job after high school, I started to work for Boomers in Irvine from December 2010 to July 2013. I was a ride operator outside and was trained in operating the various rides at the establishment. 
									 If I worked in the morning, I would be responsible for testing the rides before opening for today to make sure they passed a set of testing specifications. The two-year gap in no work was in part to me studying abroad in Germany for two years from August of 2013 to August of 2015.
